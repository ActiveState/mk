"""Makefile to test out-of-date determination through
a target that is just a virtual grouping of other targets with
real results (e.g. `finishup' depending on `sources').

Answer: mk will keep the make and rake semantics where 'finishup'
will always be re-run. To get around this, something like  a new "Alias"
would be required:

    class sources(Alias):
        targets = ["foo", "bar"]
